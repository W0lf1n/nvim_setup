# nvim_setup
This is my personal nvim configuration file, which I use on every Linux machine that I own. If someone is new to vim/nvim like I am, perhaps this will help you at the beginning when trying to get accustomed to this editor. I am still attempting to keep it as close to the default vim/nvim as possible, but with a few extra features that I like or use in other IDEs.
